# Card-Deck-Project
Created a Blackjack game simulator using Python 
A little more about the project:
In the simulator, you can add players and a dealer and the number of rounds you want to play
each player is dealt cards from the dealer 
each player including the dealer can decide to hit or stand until they hit 21 or who ever has the highest number wins.
after the rounds are over, the game is wiped and you can start all over again
this was an overall fun and challenging project to help improve my coding experience and overall Object Oriented Programming knowledge
